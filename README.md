## User Guide

Thank you for viewing my physics demo application!

This application is the result of following the Academy of Interactive Entertainment's tutorials on implementing physics in Unity. These demos demonstrate a variety of physical interactions between objects: Joints, Collisions, Meshes, Cloth Simulation, Ragdoll, Fluids, etc.

After launching the executable, you'll see a level select screen. This is the main menu. Choose the physics demo you wish to view. Every demo scene has a button at the top-left that will return you to the level select.

There is background music present throughout the application. You can adjust its volume using the slider at the bottom of the Level Select Screen / Main Menu.
